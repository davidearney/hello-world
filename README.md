# hello-world
This is the first repository I've ever created on GitHub

I'm looking to learn more about GitHub, Python, and other tools in order to become a better, more understanding Project Manager. 

I'm not a developer or a SysAdmin, but I figure the more I understand about the tools they use, the better I can be at managing projects. 

This is my first step.
