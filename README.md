# hello-world
This is the first repository I created on GitHub. I'm a little further along now, but only just, as I dropped coding due to a change in career direction, but now I'm back. 

I'm looking to learn more about GitHub, Python, SQL and other tools in order to become a better, more capable FinOps Practitioner. 

I'm not a developer or a SysAdmin, but I figure the more I understand about the tools they use, the better I can be at managing cloud costs. 

This is now my second step.
